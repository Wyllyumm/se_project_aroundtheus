Features:
This project was made with a focus on responsive design. It was made so that images display correctly at different screen resolutions. As you expand or shrinkg screen resolutions, images will compress or expand into columns as necessary.

Technology:
This was made possible through the online application Figma. With the use of Figma, images were exported and dimensions of each elemenet could be calculated, including the webpage's content dimensions. We then used other sites to optimize the images for better performance. These sites inlcuded tinypng.com and svgomg.net.
